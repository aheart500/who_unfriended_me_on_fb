# who_unfriended_me_on_fb
Lame python code that should get a list of your Facebook friends and store it locally then you can get a new list and compare between the two and figure out who unfriended you.
# How to use
First you have to install selenium module for browser automation
``` 
pip3 install selenium 
```
Then you have to download the chrome driver compatible with your chrome browser version from here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

__Note__: The code can run on any browser. Just change the selenium configuration to match your browser

Lastly, you have to provide your facebook creditintials at the beginning of the file.

If you encountered any problem don't tell me. I wrote it long time ago and I know it sucks but it just does the work for me. 

__Spoiler Alert__: You will get sad each time you use this code after knowing how removed you.
